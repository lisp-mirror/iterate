# ITERATE Maintenance Fork

This is a fork of the Jonathan Amsterdam's `ITERATE` macro library, keeping it alive, maintained, and even repaired where flaws are found.

Current version is 1.5.4 -- four patch pre-releases after the 1.5 release.  A 1.6 release is likely to come soon, as the backlog of merge requests is cleared out.

Look for this README to be expanded as time permits.

ITERATE is maintained on gitlab.common-lisp.net and mirrored on GitHub.  Issues should be posted on common-lisp.net.
